## PROJECT REQUIRMENTS 

### Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.

We used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for our CSS framework. 


### Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

Link to final project: (insert link)


### Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

The application is interactive a few ways
* navagating between screens
* collecting and displaying real time data, such as addresses, restaurant names and blob images
* allowing users to sort through choices
* saving choices locally to be accessed later on.

### Use at least two server-side APIs.

Although we trialed many APIS, in the end we used three APIs.

1. [Spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/food-api)
2. [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview)
3. [Google Photos APIs](https://developers.google.com/photos)

We also used [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to help us access API data.

### Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).

We do not use alerts, confirms or prompts. We use modals and one unavoidable popup to get users location.

### Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

The application stores favourites data as well as card data retrieved from server-side APIs.

### Be responsive.

The application is fully responsive and works on desktop, tablet and mobile.

### Have a polished UI.

The US is easy to navagate, attractive and polished.

### Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

The repository is clean, meets quality coding standards and is merged.

### Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

This is a quality Readme file with a uqique name, description, technologies used, a screenshot and a link the deployed application.
